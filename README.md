# subscribe-publish

## Challenge description

Implement a simple Publish/Subscribe library just using Golang standard librarys, able to do basic message routing based on queue names, as well as able to register all published messages in order by queue in a file system. Other requirements are:

- Tests are mandatory and coverage must be over 80%.
- The use of any external libraries is prohibited, except for Make to automate the execution of tests, if desired.
- Extra points if the library uses generics to support message types.
